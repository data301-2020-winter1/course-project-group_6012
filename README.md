{The university rankings data is provided from Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) in the United Arab Emirates, and it was uploaded on kaggle by Myles O'Neill. Our data ranks the world's universities based on employment, influence, publications, etc. Our data was collected for years 2012-2015. The purpose of our dataset is to compare universities across the world with certain criteria that may be interesting to students, academics, and the univerities themselves. The data used is soley based on verifiable data and does not depend on opinion based surveys, making the data more reliable. The data is collected by quantifying the results and history of the universities. For example alumni employment numbers, citations, awards, publications, etc.
