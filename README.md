## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{In this project, we hope to compare the relative strengths and weaknesses of universities based on criteria developed from the different factors analyzed in the dataset. Since we are all students at UBC, we are highly interested in understanding how our institution ranks compared to other universities, both nationally and internationally. One highly pertinent question for students such as ourselves to understand is what indicators may lead to a higher alumni employment rate.  As securing employment in our own specific field of interest’s post-graduation is of utmost importance for ourselves and peers, understanding how certain institutions better prepare students for the workforce, as well as how employers view the education obtained from certain institutions is of high value.  We hope that by analyzing this dataset, we will be better able to understand these factors and their relative importance as to how an institution ranks on a global scale.  We also believe our dataset can be used to build user-facing Dashboard in order to allow others to easily interpret the data and gain insight into these questions, and help inform future decisions.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The “World University Rankings” dataset is provided by the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) in the United Arab Emirates, and was uploaded to “Kaggle” by Myles O'Neill in 2019.  This dataset ranks the world's top universities based on employment, influence, publications, and other key factors for years 2012-2015.  The top 100 universities are ranked for 2012 and 2013, and the top 1000 are ranked for 2014 and 2015.  The purpose of this dataset is to compare universities across the world with certain criteria that may be informative and interesting to students, academics, and the universities themselves. The results of this dataset may help students in making informed decisions regarding what school to attend based on their priorities, whereas employers may use this dataset to evaluate potential employees’ educational merit.  The data used is solely based on verifiable, quantitative data and does not depend on opinion-based surveys, making the data more reliable. Instead, the data was collected by quantifying the results and history of the universities, such as alumni employment numbers, citations, awards, and publications.}
