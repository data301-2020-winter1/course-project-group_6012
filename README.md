## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{In this project, we hope to compare strength and weaknesses of universities based on the custom criterias. Since we are students at UBC, we are interested in seeing how well our university is compared to others. One particular question we are interested in is what indicators make a university have a high alumni employement rate. We believe our dataset can be used to build user-facing Dashboard. }

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The university rankings data is provided from Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) in the United Arab Emirates, and it was uploaded on kaggle by Myles O'Neill. Our data ranks the world's universities based on employment, influence, publications, etc. Our data was collected for years 2012-2015. The purpose of our dataset is to compare universities across the world with certain criteria that may be interesting to students, academics, and the universities themselves. The data used is soley based on verifiable data and does not depend on opinion based surveys, making the data more reliable. The data is collected by quantifying the results and history of the universities. For example alumni employment numbers, citations, awards, publications, etc.}
